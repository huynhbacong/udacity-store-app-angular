# UdacityStoreApp Client side
UdacityStoreApp is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Install Dependencies
`npm install`

#### Project features

Your application reflects the same user experience as that of a real-world e-commerce website, including a(n):

* **Home** page, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
* **Product details** page, which displays more information about any particular product
* **Cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
* **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
* **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.


## Start server
On the same terminal, run the command 
```
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
